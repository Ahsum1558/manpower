This is my running manpower project. To develop this site I am using Laravel Framework. Here Super Admin can control Admin Panel. Super Admin can create only one user. Super Admin only can create office data in English, Arabic and Bengali. Header and Footer also can be created by Super Admin. When you run project first time Super Admin create automatically. By example: username: Super and Password: 12345
In Admin Panel user can create Location Area, Visa Info, Delegate Info and Customers Info. But only Admin can delete. User can control Medical Sector, Embassy Sector, Manpower Sector.
